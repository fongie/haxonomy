# Taxonomy design document
## Purpose

The taxonomy is to be used as a knowledge base for web penetration testers. It is also to be used as a base for a tool to help penetration testers in their decision process when hacking.

## Users

Users (indexers) are the taxonimists, perhaps in the future other people knowledgeable of web vulnerabilities. Also developers who develop the decision making tool. End users are web hackers.

## Content

The taxonomy content will be exploitable web features and properties of web sites (attack surfaces).

## Scope

The scope is web clients and servers. It does not include native applications (like f.e mobile or desktop apps).

## Resources

There is funding available if necessary, for example for software.
We have until 1st of June to complete it.
Technology?
We use human indexing (not automatic).
