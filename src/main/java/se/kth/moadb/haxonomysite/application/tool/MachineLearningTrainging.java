/**
 * 1) Get current MarkovState ID
 * 2) Check which Terms in that State that are still marked as UNKNOWN
 * 3a) Check if there are any MarkovStates that equals this current MarkovState but with one more Term answered with YES or NO
 * 3b) If there are no such states, chose a Term/Action at random
 * 4a) Check which of these MarkovStates that has the highest Q value
 * 4b) If there are several MarkovStates with the same Q value, chose one at random
 * 5a) Try to go to that state by asking that Terms question
 * 6) Take the Q value the state we chose to "go to" and update this state Q value as 0.8 * the Q value of State we chose to go to
 *
 * ...Then make all the steps again for the new state
